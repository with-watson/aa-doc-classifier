If within 30 days of delivery of a firearm the buyer returns the item(s) for any internal mechanical malfunctions we will notify the consignor of the cost of repair. The consignor will then have the option to authorize proceeding with the repair and have the costs deducted from their net amount or terminate the consignment agreement and have the item(s) returned to them.
